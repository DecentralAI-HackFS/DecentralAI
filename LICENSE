# Dify Open Source License

The Dify project uses a combination of the Apache License 2.0, MIT License, and an additional agreement to protect against direct competition with Dify Cloud services.

As a contributor, you should agree that your contributed code:
a. Might be subject to a more permissive open source license in the future.
b. Can be used for commercial purposes, such as Dify's cloud business.

The following components are open source under the MIT license, allowing you to build and develop applications based on them:
- WebApp elements, e.g., web/app/components/share
- Derived WebApp Template projects

The remaining parts of the project are open source under the Apache License 2.0.

With the Apache License 2.0, MIT License, and this supplementary agreement, anyone can freely use, modify, and distribute Dify, provided that:

- If you use Dify solely as a backend service for other applications, no authorization is needed for commercial or closed source purposes.
- If you wish to use Dify for commercial and closed source SaaS services similar to Dify Cloud, please contact us for authorization.

The interactive design of this product is protected by appearance patent.
